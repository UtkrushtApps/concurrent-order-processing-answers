# Solution Steps

1. Create an 'order' package and define Order and Result structs in 'order/engine.go'.

2. Implement a ProcessOrder function that simulates processing with random failures and delays.

3. Implement a Worker function that continuously picks up orders from a channel, processes them, and sends results into another channel; decrement a WaitGroup when finished.

4. Implement ProcessOrders to start a fixed number of Worker goroutines, feed all incoming orders to a jobs channel, and collect results from a results channel.

5. Synchronize properly: close jobsCh after all orders are sent, and close resultsCh only after all workers complete (using WaitGroup).

6. In ProcessOrders, collect all results into a slice and return them once all results are gathered.

7. In main.go, seed the RNG, build a list of 25 orders, call ProcessOrders with a reasonable number of workers, and print each result with ID and state.

8. Write unit tests in 'order/engine_test.go' to validate that all orders are processed exactly once, none are lost, and each is 'completed' or 'failed'.

9. Run the tests and ensure all pass, confirming proper synchronization, correct results, and no race conditions.
